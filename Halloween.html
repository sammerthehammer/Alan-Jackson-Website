       <p>Halloween has its origins in the ancient <b>Celtic</b> festival of <b>Samhain</b>, celebrated around October 31st. The Celts believed that on this night, the boundary between the living and the <b>dead</b> was blurred, allowing spirits to return to the earth. They would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off these roaming spirits.

        With the spread of Christianity, Samhain was gradually incorporated into Christian traditions. </p>

    <p>In the 8th century, <i>Pope Gregory</i> III designated November 1st as <i>All Saints' Day</i>, a time to honor saints and <i>martyrs</i>. The night before, October 31st, became known as All Hallows' Eve, which eventually morphed into Halloween.
        
        Over time, Halloween evolved, especially in the United States, where it incorporated various customs, including trick-or-treating, carving pumpkins, and festive parties. Today, it's a blend of ancient traditions and modern celebrations.</p>
